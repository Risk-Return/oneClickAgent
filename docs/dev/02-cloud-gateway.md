## Store Tables Covered

- `users`, `refresh_tokens`, `devices`, `agents`, `jobs`, `job_files`, `files`
- `skills`, `skill_versions`, `device_skills`, `agent_skills`, `skill_grants`
- `organizations`, `audit_log`

## API Endpoints Covered

- Auth: register, login, refresh, logout, me
- Devices (admin): enroll, list, get, delete, set-pool-size, rotate-token
- Agents: list-my-agents, get, enable-skill, disable-skill; admin: list-all, drain, release
- Jobs: submit (with queue), list, get, cancel, result
- Files: upload, list, get, delete
- Skills: list-visible, get; admin: CRUD, publish-version, fleet-install/disable/update/delete, visibility, grants
- Orgs (admin): CRUD, members
- Users (admin): update-tier
- WebSocket: `/ws` realtime endpoint
- Health: `/healthz`, `/readyz`

## Key Design Decisions Matched to Spec

- Tiered FIFO job queue (`enterprise` > `pro` > `free`) per `02 §10`
- Queue TTL with `IAGENT_QUEUE_TTL`, per-user cap `IAGENT_MAX_QUEUED_PER_USER`
- Agent pool: `IDLE → BUSY → IDLE` lifecycle via DB-stored allocation
- Reverse tunnel hub with read/write pumps, ack tracking, liveness checker
- Chunked file push (256KiB) with SHA-256 + backpressure (≤8 in-flight)
- Skill visibility: `public` / `user grant` / `org grant` resolution
- Skill fleet dispatch: `DISPATCH_BEGIN → CHUNK → DISPATCH_END → SKILL_ACTION`
- JWT access + rotating refresh tokens with theft detection
- Argon2id password hashing with 12-char minimum

## Known Gaps / TODOs

- [x] Database migrations (`gateway/migrations/` — up/down SQL created)
- [x] Unit tests (model, config, auth, tunnel, pubsub, pool, channel — 7 packages)
- [ ] Integration tests (testcontainers + fake device WS client — store layer needs real DB)
- [ ] Prometheus metrics wiring (obs package has placeholder)
- [ ] OpenTelemetry tracing
- [ ] Redis-backed tunnel registry for multi-instance (v1 is single-instance)
- [ ] HTTP API handler tests (requires HTTP test server + mock stores)

## Git History
